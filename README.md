#FileOrganizer
##About
FileOrganizer is a small application that lets you organize a stack of files into their appropriate folders.
To do this, FileOrganizer opens the files in the chosen folder one by one, and by pressing a num key, you can decide which of the folders you've chosen, this file should be moved to. You can also delete by pressing 0 or let stay by pressing +.
The app then moves the file in a seperate thread, and opens the next file.
